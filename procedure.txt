#####   Procedure of building a system with FastAPI #####


1. Create the "main.py" file. Inside that, import the fastapi module & build simple APIs using simple python-methods.

2. After building the method & decorating with the instance of FastAPI ("app"), we need to start the server, we use the following cmd.
    uvicorn main:app --reload

    Syntax:  uvicorn fileName:FastAPI_objectName --reload

NB:  Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server, which can be used to run django-projects. 
    The operation that is wrapped with a FastAPI decorator, is called "Path Operation Function".


-----------------> Break down of FastAPI

2. Initialize empty git repository in the working directory.
    Also create the ".gitignore" file.

3. For dynamic routing in the path of FastAPI decorator, we use second-bracket "{}" along with the pathName string leading a forward-slash.
    Then we can use that as a variable in the 


-----------------> [ Path Parameter ]  Pass id/ other data dynamically inside the FastAPI routing-path
    To use that in the path-operation-functions.

4. Firstly use the second bracket in the path-string. To use this path-string-variable inside the path-operation-function,
    we need to use param in the method. By default, it will use the dynamic value as string inside the methods.

5. To define the value as string/ integer/ boolean/ float, it's required to define inside the method's parameter.


-----------------> FastAPI using Swagger UI for Frontend UI

6. To view the developed APIs in the browser, use "docs" keyword after the base-url ( "http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs/" )

7. Use "redoc" after the base-url ( "http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs/" )


-----------------> [ Query Parameter ] Pass Query Parameter in the routing-string.

[ NB ]:  Query parameters are not going to change the routing path of the FastAPI path. We can accept the query parameter 
    from the routing-path-string using paramterized function.

( Pass 'limit' query paramter)
8. Use the browser to use query in the routing-path by using the "?limit=10", then it can be fetched inside the function using
    the paraterized function. ( Please view the "blogList" function )


-----------------> [ Path Parameter ] Pass Default Path Parameter, thus it'll not throw errors for the not passing required paramters.

9. Inidividually specify default values for all the parameters of a method. Thus it'll not throw an error & asked for the values of the parameters.

10. If any optional paramters is passed in the method, then we are required to define that using the keyword "Optional" following the colon. 
    Then assign that parameter with "None".


-----------------> How does FastAPI know if the parameter is a query-param or a path-param?

[ Note ]:  FastAPI is smart enough to understand that if a variable is accepted in the method-param, and it matches any dynamic variable of the path-string,
    then it'll operate as path-parameter, otherwise, it'll treat other parameters as query-parameters.
    ANd it'll throw an error, if any defult value is not defined for the params as well as not metioned in the url while hitting the API.


-----------------> API: Create a new blog 

11. For creating a new blog inside the DB, we first need to establish the connection with the database.

12. [ Establish DB Connection ]: inside the "database.py"
        Create the db-engine using the SQLAlchemy. Here we need to define the db path in the directory. Initially, we are using the SQLite DB.
        Then need to instansiate the db-table mapping using the "declarative_base" module.
        Create the DB session using the sessionmaker.
    
[ NB ]:  The model-class inside the "schemas.py" is responsible for creating the request-body in the browser/ client/ user-end.
        The model-class inside the "models.py" is responsible for mapping the db-table as well as table-fields in the DB.

13. [ "main.py" ]  For making the migrations inside the DB, we need to define the engine using the following code-block.
            models.Base.metadata.create_all( engine )
    Create the function ( "create_blog" ) to create the row inside the DB.

[ IMPORTANT ]:  Any API function interacting with the DB should have the "db" param whose type will be define as Session inported from the "sqlalchemy.orm".


-----------------> Exception & Status Code

[ NB ]:  When we create an API, it's very important to provide an appropriate status-code.

14. We can define the status code inside the api-path-decorator with an extra parameter.
    Follow the link below to define the appropriate http-status-codes.
        https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html#http.HTTPStatus
    [ or follow ]:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
    
    [ Alternatively - better approach ]: Import the "Status" module from the "fastapi" & 
        use that in the "status_code" param. The VS Code auto-complete will help to guide.

15. To ensure appropriate status-code while handling exception, we are required to use the "Response" module imported from "fastapi".
    The response param in the method will be as "Response".
    The status_code param will be overriden.
